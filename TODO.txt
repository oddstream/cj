COMMONPLACE JOURNAL TODO

[ ] cj needs some proper refactoring

[ ] https://github.com/aarzilli/nucular
	can set style in RichText widget, eg
	c.SetStyleForSel(findSel(bigEnchillada, "it's a false hologram, it is artificial"), richtext.TextStyle{Face: italic})

[X] func (e *Entry) SelectedText() string
	link toolbar icon (no builtin)
	launch in browser

[-] find the bit of code in widget.Entry that puts text onto the screen
	and add a hook that allows highlighting

[-] redo in Gtk
	use https://wiki.gnome.org/Projects/GtkSourceView
	or https://codebrainz.github.io/GtkScintilla/
	too complicated

[ ] ReadStuffLater uses emojis to tag content

[X] maybe found list should show dates, instead of first lines?
	or somehow manage to show line where hit words are

[ ] get rid of widen/narrow/exclude popup?
	parse "or" "and" "not" in searchEntry (these would be stopwords anyway)
	strictly left to right, no parentheses
	would it be tricky to do as it's typed?
	dog
	dog food
	dog or cat
	dog food or cat food not grapes
		find "dog food"
		push or
		find "cat food"
		push not
	...problem using ' or " around query string to find phrases

[ ] title no longer shows name of journal
	go back to olde style app title
	put today's date somewhere else
	make today's name region-sensitive

[ ] experiment with using custom icons in toolbar
	48 png, ok, svg not drawing, investigate the fyne source

[X] deprecate putting 'Mon 17 Jul 2023' as the first line of every note
	by displaying the current date somewhere else, like a pseudo title field
	put a button widget in the toolbar
	println(t.Format("Mon 2 Jan 2006"))
	https://gosamples.dev/date-time-format-cheatsheet/
	set button text in setCurrent()

[ ] think about using json to store notes
	hashtag field

[ ] now we use grep for search
	how about using an external editor?
	https://micro-editor.github.io/
	piggyback found words/hashtags on syntax highlighting

[ ] don't really need to prev/next day toolbar icons
	could add shortcuts

[ ] shortcuts
	see "Adding shortcuts to an Entry" at https://developer.fyne.io/explore/shortcuts
	to add shorts to note multilinentry, for save, find all etc
	how to do Ctrl+Left/Right &c? no way to set Entry selection?
	see suggested enhancement https://github.com/fyne-io/fyne/issues/2462
	can get CursorRow, CursorColumn int
	Entry.InsertText() https://github.com/fyne-io/fyne/issues/3445

[ ] three finders
	dynamic find (type in the entry, list is dynamically displayed)
	find hashtags (find all hashtags using regexp, display in list)
	find/widen/narrow/exclude
	(not find all, that was in com)

[ ] steal ideas from https://www.tagspaces.org
[ ] findAll is finding them all but not displaying properly
	the last file found is missing
	oh, now it's working?
	...only when main window/list is resized
	...suggesting it's a Fyne bug
[ ] com: image files as notes, preview, note with same name as image, contain description, source, hashtags?
	cat_washing.gif
	cat_washing.txt
[ ] com: color-codes notes? aren't Books and #hashtags enough?
	scan for #blue #red #green tags and change theme when loading
[ ] detect if note has changed on disk
[X] com find all notes
[ ] DocumentCreateIcon
[ ] more visible caret in entry widget
[ ] Find the Entry source, read it, roll your own?

[ ] MarkText-style hamburger menu
	set font
	set light/dark theme
	create backup

	see the following source for dialog.FileOpen
	https://github.com/fyne-io/fyne/blob/v2.3.4/dialog/file.go
	https://github.com/fyne-io/fyne/blob/master/dialog/file.go

[ ] func NewRichTextFromMarkdown(content string) *RichText
	RichText can't be edited, but could be used as pop-up display of a Markdown note
	so open a preview pane to the right of the MultiLineEntry pane
[ ] Entry.SetMinRowsVisible
[ ] could AddShortcut to widget.Entry canvas
[ ] .txt/.md switch?
[ ] more support for #tags? insert from dict? search for tag?
[ ] fyne.AppMetaData
[ ] app desktop icon
	create a .desktop file in /usr/share/applications
[ ] Update list if note title edited (on save, implied reloading note)
[ ] copy .SelectedText() to find entry when Ctrl+F
[ ] Backup to .zip file 'nincomp<date of backup>.zip'
[ ] found list has two columns: date (ISO 8601) and text (first line)?
[ ] follow url link in text
	find all url in text
	https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6038061/regular-expression-to-find-urls-within-a-string
	show list of found urls in a popup, click to follow
	...the list would look nasty, and be very wide
	- or -
	extend selection forwards & backwards to cover a url (step 1, testable)
	func (e *Entry) SelectedText() string
	follow selected url

[ ] autocomplete https://addons.fyne.io/addons/io.fyne-x.completion-entry.html
	based on https://pkg.go.dev/fyne.io/x/fyne/widget#CompletionEntry

[ ]	List names of .nincomp subdirectories at start; choose one

[ ] redo in Haxe/HaxeUI
	has calendars
[ ] redo as vscode extension(s)?
	calendar https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=miyamotoh.vscal2
[ ] redo in Go/Gio UI https://gioui.org/doc/learn
	the text edit supports Ctrl+Left/Right, fo a start
	have to create your own calendar
[ ] redo in Dart/Flutter
[ ] redo in Tcl/Tk (roll your own date picker, examples in tkinter)
	https://core.tcl-lang.org/tklib/doc/trunk/embedded/md/tklib/files/modules/widget/widget_calendar.md
	https://github.com/tcltk/tklib/blob/master/modules/widget/calendar.tcl
[ ] redo in Java/JavaFX (has a nice calendar/date picker), Grep4J library,
	use the JavaFX Scene Builder (not JavaFX Script, which is discontinued)
	Maven, Gradle, OpenJDK, JavaFX versions ...

[ ] redo in https://gioui.org/
	calendar widget
[ ] redo in Bubbletea
	https://golangscript.com/g/line-editor-based-on-the-bubbletea-library
[x] redo in www.electronjs.org/ (like marktext, vscode), but then it would be huge.
[x] redo in Gambas (no date picker?)
[x] redo in https://xojo.com $399/year to write BASIC apps? No thank you.
[x] redo in Ruby/Shoes (learn Ruby and roll your own date picker) (editor might be shit, again)
[x] redo on Vala/GTK, but then it would be Gnome only, no Windows, Mac, mobile. So what?
	https://wiki.gnome.org/Projects/Vala/Tutorial


[ ] fyne tries to open /home/gilbert/.config/incrementaljournal/preferences.json
	and /home/gilbert/.config/fyne/settings.json
	and /home/gilbert/.config/fyne/theme.json
	according to strace

[ ] func funcName(a INTERFACETYPE) CONCRETETYPE

[X] Move cjNote.pathname to Note.Pathname
[X] why load the text off all notes?
[X] do something with Mon 1 Jan 0001
[X] filter out files that start with '.'

[x] little button to clear the searchEntry
[x] convert all found #hashtags into lower case
[x] search uses grep; retire search.go to .junk
[x] com retired to .junk
[x] new name - cj - commonplace journal?
[x] com: find a note, create a new note, then click on found note: nothing happens, stuck on new note
	implies create new note should zap the found list?
[x] different books in tabs? no, open different instances
[x] append only notes app (see incremental notes from https://thesephist.com/posts/inc/)
	my favorite color was red, now it's blue
[x] com and inc should have different icons
[x] rname from goldnotebook to something else cominc incom incomp increcom nincomp(oop)
[x] search (for regexp) returns found word(s)?
[x] cmd to search for all #hashtags, display popup list, click to search for that
[x] split into inc and com
[x] regex search returns list of found wordlets
[x] open book needs to offer to create book
[x] search when input happens in search entry
[x] app version and --version
[x] Toolbar: | book | <prev day | today | next day> | preview
[x] No need for find button
[x] Common/General notebook plus separate notebooks for TV, GT7,  ...
[x] word wrap
[x] Enter to search after typing in entry widget
[x] Calendar highlight to follow current, not today
[x] font could be bigger
[x] why have undated notes at all?
	solve the problem of having >1 notes with same name
	(currently notes can be overwritten)
	undated notes remain hidden until found
	there wouldn't have to be a ^N "Create new note"
	if you want to make a "cooking" note, just pick an empty date in the past
	and create a "cooking" note
	why not create .goldnotebook/cooking.txt? the fname-to-date parser would fail,
	but that's ok because it's expected
	or "create note" could prompt for filename? that's no longer as simple as possible
	conclusion: undated notes add complexity for marginal gain
[x] Calendar - highlight current date
[x] Create new undated note
[x] Adding multiple hits to result
[x] Load note directly from list item?
[x] Font - use a system font if possible, if not embed Droid Sans Mono
[x] Parse filename into date
[x] Populate list from results of grup
[x] Grup to produce list of matching filenames
[x] have dated and undated directories
[x] Detect app exit to save current note
[x] Calendar - widget.Resize() width (put it in a centered container)
[x] list only displaying 1 of 3 items

FYNE PROBLEMS
- If the focus is in the MultiLineEntry, the keyboard shortcuts seem to be directed to that instead of canvas
- RichText is readonly, and support for markdown is poor, and even poorer with a monospace font
- SizeNameLineSpacing seems to be ignored by MultiLineEntry
- SpellChecker https://github.com/fyne-io/fyne/issues/2325
- Can't use Ctrl+Right/Left to move words
- Waiting to implement widget tooltips (it's raised as an issue)
- MultiLineEntry text rendering is uneven
- Caret is too small
- Can't highlight hit words or spelling errors
- Text copied appears in other entry widgets, and other apps, but not in Ubuntu desktop
- flicker when reshowing calendar (not all the time - when note gets saved?)
- No Ctrl Z undo in entry widget
