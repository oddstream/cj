NINCOMP TODO


[ ] MarkText-style hamburger menu
	set font
	set light/dark theme
	create backup

[ ] different books in tabs? no, open different instances

	see the following source for dialog.FileOpen
	https://github.com/fyne-io/fyne/blob/v2.3.4/dialog/file.go
	https://github.com/fyne-io/fyne/blob/master/dialog/file.go

[ ] func NewRichTextFromMarkdown(content string) *RichText
	RichText can't be edited, but could be used as pop-up display of a Markdown note
	so open a preview pane to the right of the MultiLineEntry pane
[ ] Entry.SetMinRowsVisible
[ ] could AddShortcut to widget.Entry canvas
[ ] .txt/.md switch?
[ ] more support for #tags? insert from dict?
[ ] fyne.AppMetaData
[ ] app desktop icon
	create a .desktop file in /usr/share/applications
[ ] Update list if note title edited (on save, implied reloading note)
[ ] search is case sensitive
[ ] copy .SelectedText() to find entry when Ctrl+F
[ ] Backup to .zip file 'nincomp<date of backup>.zip'
[ ] found list has two columns: date (ISO 8601) and text (first line)?
[ ] follow url link in text
	find all url in text
	https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6038061/regular-expression-to-find-urls-within-a-string
	show list of found urls in a popup, click to follow
	...the list would look nasty, and be very wide
	- or -
	extend selection forwards & backwards to cover a url (step 1, testable)
	func (e *Entry) SelectedText() string
	follow selected url

[ ] autocomplete https://addons.fyne.io/addons/io.fyne-x.completion-entry.html
	based on https://pkg.go.dev/fyne.io/x/fyne/widget#CompletionEntry
[ ] append only notes app (see incremental notes from https://thesephist.com/posts/inc/)
	my favorite color was red, now it's blue
[ ]	List names of .nincomp subdirectories at start; choose one
[ ] redo in Dart/Flutter
[ ] redo in www.electronjs.org/ (like marktext, vscode)
[ ] redo in Gambas (no date picker?)
[ ] redo in Xojo
[ ] redo in Tcl/Tk
[ ] redon in Java/JavaFX (has a nice calendar/date picker), Grep4J library,


[ ] func funcName(a INTERFACETYPE) CONCRETETYPE


[x] com and inc should have different icons
[x] rname from goldnotebook to something else cominc incom incomp increcom nincomp(oop)
[x] search (for regexp) returns found word(s)?
[x] cmd to search for all #hashtags, display popup list, click to search for that
[x] split into inc and com
[x] regex search returns list of found wordlets
[x] open book needs to offer to create book
[x] search when input happens in search entry
[x] app version and --version
[x] Toolbar: | book | <prev day | today | next day> | preview
[x] No need for find button
[x] Common/General notebook plus separate notebooks for TV, GT7,  ...
[x] word wrap
[x] Enter to search after typing in entry widget
[x] Calendar highlight to follow current, not today
[x] font could be bigger
[x] why have undated notes at all?
	solve the problem of having >1 notes with same name
	(currently notes can be overwritten)
	undated notes remain hidden until found
	there wouldn't have to be a ^N "Create new note"
	if you want to make a "cooking" note, just pick an empty date in the past
	and create a "cooking" note
	why not create .goldnotebook/cooking.txt? the fname-to-date parser would fail,
	but that's ok because it's expected
	or "create note" could prompt for filename? that's no longer as simple as possible
	conclusion: undated notes add complexity for marginal gain
[x] Calendar - highlight current date
[x] Create new undated note
[x] Adding multiple hits to result
[x] Load note directly from list item?
[x] Font - use a system font if possible, if not embed Droid Sans Mono
[x] Parse filename into date
[x] Populate list from results of grup
[x] Grup to produce list of matching filenames
[x] have dated and undated directories
[x] Detect app exit to save current note
[x] Calendar - widget.Resize() width (put it in a centered container)
[x] list only displaying 1 of 3 items

FYNE PROBLEMS
- If the focus is in the MultiLineEntry, the keyboard shortcuts seem to be directed to that instead of canvas
- RichText is readonly, and support for markdown is poor, and even poorer with a monospace font
- SizeNameLineSpacing seems to be ignored by MultiLineEntry
- SpellChecker https://github.com/fyne-io/fyne/issues/2325
- Can't use Ctrl+Right/Left to move words
- Waiting to implement widget tooltips (it's raised as an issue)
- MultiLineEntry text rendering is uneven
- Caret is too small
- Can't highlight hit words or spelling errors
- Text copied appears in other entry widgets, and other apps, but not in Ubuntu desktop
- flicker when reshowing calendar (not all the time - when note gets saved?)
- No Ctrl Z undo in entry widget
