# Commonplace and Incremental

There is [a lot of note-taking software out there](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_note-taking_software), and the trouble with most of it is that it's too darn complicated. Which is a shame, because note-taking is something a lot of people do with computers.

There are simple exceptions like [Google Keep](https://keep.google.com/#home) and [thinktype](https://thinktype.app/) but it seems to me most of the big hitters become useless to most people because they require so much investment in learning how to use them.

## Types of note taking

1. [Commonplace books](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonplace_book) Leonardo da Vinci kept all of his notes in one big book. If he liked something he put it down. This is known as a commonplace book, and it is about how detailed your note-taking system should be unless you plan on thinking more elaborately than Leonardo da Vinci.
2. [Zettelkasten](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zettelkasten) or a card file: small items of information stored on paper slips or cards that may be linked to each other through subject headings or other metadata such as numbers and tags.
3. [Incremental notes](https://thesephist.com/posts/inc/) are like a diary, but for notes: start a new page every day and fill it with what you're doing, not doing, or reading, or whatever.

In the late 1990s, I wrote something called [Idealist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IdeaList) that's still being used.
